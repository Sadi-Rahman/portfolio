          I am a passionate developer who loves building intuitive web
          applications. When Iâ€™m not immersed in building websites, I enjoy
          reading books. Be it fiction, non-fiction or even fantasy, I love them
          all. I belive that continuous learning is the key to personal growth
          and development. I am always eager to learn new technologies and
          improve my skills.
